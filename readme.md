Thus file should describe what the project is about and its goals

Maybe use the image with the project structure as a general guide/index



Project: simulate a random catalogue of stars

- Stars should have randomized sky positions around the Andromeda galaxy
- Positions should fall within 1 degree of the central location
- Each star should have a unique ID
- The star ID and position should be saved in a csv file to be analyzed by other programs
